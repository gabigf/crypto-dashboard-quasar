# Crypto Dashboard
I built this project to deepen my understanding of securely managing API keys by creating a Node.js server. The app includes a currency converter, allowing users to enter an amount, select "from" and "to" currencies, and view the converted amount. Additionally, a news feed provides the latest cryptocurrency news, offering users up-to-date information on digital currencies.
